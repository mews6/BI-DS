\chapter{Introduction to Machine Learning}

In order to work on machine learning, we must understand the nature of the field. As it comes to be understood, a 
first assumption we'll see is to assume 'Artificial Intelligence' as a sort of synonym. However, there is a distinction
to be made for the sake of scientific accuracy, as the hope Artificial Intelligence has, as it is the emulation of human 
intelligence in problem solving might be quite broader to the scope of current public scientific knowledge. 

a definition of Machine Learning, for our purpouses is:

"The science of programming computers in order for them to learn according to their data"

This subset of the field of Artificial Intelligence, will by it's own, become a whole area of study with it's own subsets, such as 
deep learning.
